            <li>It's hard for me to choose someone I look up to, mostly because the people in my life aren't exactly role models. That being said I push myself so I can be someone others can look up to.</li>
            <li>People who chew with their mouth open drives me insane.</li>
            <li>I love playing games that involve no skill whatsoever so i can actually relax.</li>
            <li>I feel like theres a lot of things I could do a little better but I take pride in being mediocre at best at almost everything I do.</li>
            <li>I'd probably be gaming if i wasn't in class right now.</li>
